## What is Chinese Zodiac Compatibility?

## Compatibility Frameworks

### 1. Triangle Compatibility (Most Important)

Signs are grouped into 4 triangles of 3 animals each. Signs in the same triangle are naturally compatible:

**Creative Triangle**: Rat, Dragon, Monkey
- Natural understanding and shared ambitions
- Excellent for business partnerships and creative projects

**Hardworking Triangle**: Ox, Snake, Rooster
- Reliable and dependable relationships
- Good for long-term commitments

**Dynamic Triangle**: Tiger, Horse, Goat
- Energetic and expressive partnerships
- Great for adventurous activities

**Gentle Triangle**: Rabbit, Pig, Dog
- Caring and supportive relationships
- Ideal for family-oriented connections

### 2. Polar Relationships (Opposites Attract)

Each sign has a "polar opposite" that creates magnetic attraction:

| Sign | Polar Opposite |
|------|----------------|
| Rat | Horse |
| Ox | Goat |
| Tiger | Monkey |
| Rabbit | Rooster |
| Dragon | Dog |
| Snake | Pig |
| Horse | Rat |
| Goat | Ox |
| Monkey | Tiger |
| Rooster | Rabbit |
| Dog | Dragon |
| Pig | Snake |

**Polar relationships offer:**
- Strong attraction and excitement
- Growth opportunities through differences
- Need patience and communication

### 3. Secret Friends (Hidden Harmony)

Some signs have "secret friends" - signs that seem incompatible but actually get along well:

| Sign | Secret Friend |
|------|---------------|
| Rat | Ox |
| Tiger | Pig |
| Rabbit | Dog |
| Dragon | Rooster |
| Snake | Monkey |
| Horse | Goat |

**Secret friend relationships:**
- Develop slowly over time
- Deep, unspoken understanding
- May not be obvious to others

## How to Calculate Compatibility

### Step 1: Find Your Signs
Look up your birth years to find your animal signs.

### Step 2: Check Triangle Compatibility
Are you in the same triangle? If yes, you likely have natural harmony.

### Step 3: Check Polar Relationships
Are you polar opposites? If yes, expect attraction with some challenges.

### Step 4: Check Secret Friends
Are you secret friends? If yes, your relationship may grow stronger over time.

### Step 5: Consider Elements
Each sign has an element (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) that affects compatibility:
- Same element: Neutral to positive
- Generating element: Very compatible
- Controlling element: Challenging
- Controlled element: Difficult
