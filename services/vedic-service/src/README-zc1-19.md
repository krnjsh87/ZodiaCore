## Configuration

### Constants and Thresholds

The system uses configurable constants defined in `remedy-constants.js`:

- **Affliction Thresholds**: MILD (0.3), MODERATE (0.6), SEVERE (0.8)

- **Timing Multipliers**: Effectiveness multipliers for different timing qualities

### Customization

Remedy databases can be extended by modifying:
- `MANTRA_DATABASE`: Add new mantras for planets
- `POOJA_DATABASE`: Add new pooja procedures
- `GEMSTONE_DATABASE`: Add new gemstone recommendations
